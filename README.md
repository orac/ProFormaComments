## Overview

So, on the [Android Enthusiasts' Stack Exchange](http://android.stackexchange.com), we have a problem. Users post a lot of off-topic questions, and they are often off-topic for the same reason. In such cases, it's more helpful to add a pro-forma comment explaining why the question is off-topic than to simply close it with the general off-topic description the site gives.

Use [this userscript](http://stackapps.com/questions/2116/autoreviewcomments-pro-forma-comments-for-se) with the following link as a `remote source`. Then, when you add a comment, an **auto** button appears, letting you fill in the comment automatically from this list.
